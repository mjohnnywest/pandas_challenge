# pandas_challenge
This module uses pandas and numpy libraries, so make sure you can import both into your code
This also is in a .ipynb format. VS code and Jupyter notebook can both open this type of file

Analysis of the data can be found in the file titled "Module 4 Written Report.docx"

## Instructions
1. Ensure "PyCitySchools.ipynb" is in the same directory as the "Resouces" folder
2. Ensure both "schools_complete.csv" and "students_complete.csv" are inside the "Resources" folder
3. Open "PyCitySchools.ipynb" and run each block sequentially
4. Open and read "Module 4 Written Report.docx" for analysis of presented data

## Notes
All necessary files are in the main directory and the "Resources" directory. The archive contains earlier versions, incase an earlier edit needs to be reverted to.

All code is my own, or from the pandas_challege starter. Stack Overflow was used extensively throughout this process
